# Networks Project V1

To run the project, ensure that you have python 3.3 or newer installed. All libraries used are default python libraries.

After python is installed, run the server first by **first navigating to the server directory, then** using

```python3 project_server_ryanmilewski.py```

Then you can run the client in a new terminal after the server is active by **first navigating to the client directory, then** using

```python3 project_client_ryanmilewski.py```
